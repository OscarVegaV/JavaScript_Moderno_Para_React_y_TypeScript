// ** Conditionals and Comparison Operators ** 

// Defining variables 'available' as the current balance and 'withdraw' as the withdrawal amount
const available = 4000;
const withdraw = 200;

// Defining a variable 'auth' to represent authentication status
const auth = true;

// ** Checking authentication status ** 
if (auth) {
  // Condition fulfilled: user is authenticated
  console.log('Acceso al sistema ...');
} else {
  // Condition not fulfilled: user is not authenticated
  console.log('NO tienes permiso, Inicia SesiÃ³n!');
}

// ** Checking if balance is sufficient for withdrawal ** 
if (available >= withdraw) {
  console.log('Retiro correcto'); // Balance is sufficient for withdrawal
} else {
  console.log('Montos insuficientes'); // Balance is insufficient for withdrawal
}
